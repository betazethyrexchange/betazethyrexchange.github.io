    introduceContent2: "Normally, the trading fee is 0.1%. However, if users convert their ZTR to TradingPower, they can enjoy daily quota of free trading. At any given time, the entire exchange handles a fixed quota of free trading, which is determined by VotingPower holders. The ratio of free trading quota of an account to that of an entire exchange is equal to the ratio of the accountâ€™s TradingPower to the total TradingPower across the exchange at that time.",

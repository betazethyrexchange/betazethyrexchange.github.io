    introduceContent1: "EcoPower is for token holders who would like to passively enjoy the economic benefits from the exchange. ZTR holders can convert their ZTR to EcoPower at the rate of 1 to 1.",
    introduceContent2: "The first use case of EcoPower is to give holders weekly dividends. The amount of dividend received by each holder will be proportional to his EcoPower and calculated at the end of every day, Eastern time. The daily dividend is accumulated and claimable by the end of Sunday, Eastern time. 100 percent of the exchange transaction fee is distributed via dividends. Users can retrieve the original number of ZTR immediately by unstaking their EcoPower which takes 24 hours to complete. While EcoPower is unstaking, holders will not enjoy any dividend. The amount of dividend is only calculated at the end of every day; therefore, if users unstake their EcoPower before the end of the day, they will not receive any dividends for the day."
